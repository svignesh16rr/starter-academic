'With the advancement in network infrastructure and the growth of IoT, more and more vehicular systems are getting connected. Architectures like Information Centric Networks (ICN) are being explored for vehicular communication to achieve robust content distribution in highly mobile, dynamic, and error prone domains. Consumer mobility is implicitly supported in ICN while producer mobility is an important challenge. In this paper, we design a mechanism to support producer mobility using the spatial locality of moving producers and reverse paths of data. Then, we model the consumer (requesting) application as a GI/M/c/N queue which is used to estimate system parameters like content delivery time distribution. We perform simulations using real world traces to evaluate the accuracy and working of our model.'
