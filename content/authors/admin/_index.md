# Broadly speaking, I am interested in Network Security and Privacy. 
# Presently, I am working on stochastic network design and verifying user privacy using formal methods.
# My doctoral research was on modeling the performance and enhancing the privacy of [ICN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking) routers.
# Prior to that, during my Masters, I worked with [T. Venkatesh](https://www.iitg.ac.in/t.venkat/production/index.html) and Rakesh Tripathi on fault tolerant resource planning for data centers.

# I have spent a few months visiting [Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/) at the[ University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
