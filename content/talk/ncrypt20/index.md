summary: While in-network caching is an essential feature of Information Centric Networks (ICN) for improved content dissemination and reducing the bandwidth consumption at the core of the network, it is prone to many privacy treats. For example, an adversary can passively breach the privacy of a consumer by simply analyzing the different retrieval times for the same content. We aim to address this problem of timing analysis attacks by developing a differentially private off-path caching strategy.

abstract: Many new Internet architectures have been proposed for efficient distribution and retrieval of content. Information Centric Networks is one such architecture where the consumer only needs to know “what” is the content unlike the current Internet in which the consumer is required to know “where” the content located as well. While in-network caching is an essential feature of Information Centric Networks (ICN) for improved content dissemination and reducing the bandwidth consumption at the core of the network, it is prone to many privacy treats. For example, an adversary can passively breach the privacy of a consumer by simply analyzing the different retrieval times for the same content. We aim to address this problem of timing analysis attacks by developing a differentially private off-path caching strategy.
