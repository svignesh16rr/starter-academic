abstract: 'Many future Internet architectures have been proposed to address issues like increasing traffic, mobility, efficient content dissemination and Named Data Networks (NDN) is emerging as one of the fundamental designs. With the ever-growing mobile data traffic, providing user-mobility has become a necessity. While consumer mobility is implicitly handled in NDN, producer mobility is still of one the main challenges. In this paper we propose a hop-count based forwarding strategy to support seamless producer mobility. The key idea of this strategy is: the router makes a decision based on the number of hops traveled by the interest whether to forward the interest using Forwarding Information Base (FIB) entries or broadcast it. The intuition behind this strategy being two-fold: spatial locality of producer and data packets follow the reverse path of interests in NDN. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach and compare it with Neighbor Aware Interest Forwarding. We demonstrate that our proposed strategy achieves better throughput in terms of number of interests served while reducing the overall traffic generated.'
