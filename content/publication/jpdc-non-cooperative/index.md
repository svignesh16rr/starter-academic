abstract: 'n this paper we propose an algorithm for load balancing in distributed data centers based on game theory. We model the load balancing problem as a non-cooperative game among the front-end proxy servers. We model the operating cost associated with a data center as a weighted linear combination of the energy cost and the latency cost. We propose a non-cooperative load balancing game with the objective of minimizing the operating cost and obtain the structure of Nash equilibrium. Based on this structure, a distributed load balancing algorithm is designed. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the existing approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the solution achieved by the proposed algorithm approximates the global optimal solution in terms of the cost and it also ensures fairness among the users.'
